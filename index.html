FAQ
Does the solar panel fully charge the bank? The panel provides a helpful top‑up in sun. For fastest full charges, use a wall adapter via USB‑C.
Is it allowed on airplanes? Most airlines allow power banks up to 100Wh (≈27,000 mAh @3.7V) in carry‑on. At 20,000 mAh you’re typically within limits.
Warranty & returns? 12‑month limited warranty for manufacturing defects. 30‑day returns if unused and in original packaging.
